# üöó Expanded Analysis of OOP Concepts, Threading, and Work Distribution

---

## üì¶ Importance of OOP Concepts

### 1. **Encapsulation**:
Encapsulation ensures that the internal state of objects is hidden and only accessible through defined interfaces (getters and setters). In this project:

- The **EV** class encapsulates details like charge level, current position, and path, preventing unintended behavior by restricting direct modifications.
- The **GameMap** class encapsulates the entire road network, exposing methods like `isWalkable`, `getRoadNode`, and `getObstacleMap`, providing controlled access to map data.

By encapsulating data, developers can focus on using high-level methods without worrying about the details, simplifying debugging and extending functionality.

---

### 2. **Inheritance**:
Inheritance promotes code reuse and logical hierarchy by allowing specialized classes to derive functionality from base classes.

- The **Node** class acts as a base class representing a generic point in the road network. Specialized classes like **TrafficNode** inherit from it to add traffic light management.
- The **EV** class is extended by **NPCVehicle** to model autonomous behaviors. For example:
  - **EV** handles basic movement and task assignment.
  - **NPCVehicle** introduces randomness in destination selection and re-routing logic via the overridden `changeEnd()` method.

---

### 3. **Polymorphism**:
Polymorphism allows different objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling dynamic method dispatch.

- **Nodes** and **Traffic Nodes**:
  - The **GameMap** interacts seamlessly with **TrafficNode** objects due to polymorphism.
  - Example: `getTrafficNode()` in **RoadMapParser** dynamically checks node types, allowing flexible interactions with both **Node** and **TrafficNode** instances.

- **EV** and **NPCVehicle**:
  - The **EVController** manages **EV** objects but also handles **NPCVehicle** instances due to their shared parent class.
  - Example: When `simulateEVMovement` is called, **NPCVehicle**'s overridden `changeEnd()` ensures specific behaviors without needing separate logic.

---

### 4. **Abstraction**:
Abstraction simplifies complex processes:

- **PathfindingVisualizer** abstracts JNI-based native pathfinding logic, exposing a high-level `findPath()` method while hiding the C++ implementation.
- **TrafficManager** abstracts signal handling and movement constraints, offering methods like `canMoveToPosition` without exposing signal state complexities.

---

### 5. **Singleton Pattern**:
The **GameMap**, **TrafficManager**, and **TaskAssigner** use the Singleton pattern to ensure only one instance of each exists. This centralization avoids inconsistencies and ensures shared data access.

---

## üßµ Threading and Its Importance

Threading is vital for real-time simulation. Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs utilized:

### 1. **Simultaneous Execution**:
- Each EV simulation runs in its own thread, allowing independent movement.
- Example: In **EVController**, `simulateEVMovement` spawns threads for each EV, ensuring one EV waiting at a signal doesn't block others.

---

### 2. **Real-time Updates**:
- Threads periodically update the map visualization and EV statuses, providing dynamic feedback for users.

---

### 3. **Synchronization Challenges**:
- Shared resources (e.g., **evMap**) require thread-safety mechanisms like locks or synchronized blocks to prevent race conditions.

---

### 4. **Task Management**:
- **TaskAssigner** distributes tasks among EVs in a thread-safe manner, with threads polling for tasks from a shared buffer.

---

## üîó Detailed Analysis of Nodes and Traffic Nodes

### 1. **Node Class**:
- Represents a generic graph node with attributes like coordinates, neighbors, and stalled status.
- Implements `equals()` and `hashCode()` based on coordinates for efficient lookups.

---

### 2. **TrafficNode Class**:
- Inherits from **Node** and adds traffic-specific functionality like signal states and traffic types.
- Integrated into the network via polymorphism, dynamically casting **Node** objects to **TrafficNode** as needed.

---

### 3. **Interaction Between Node and TrafficNode**:
- Polymorphism ensures **TrafficNode** behaves as a **Node** in pathfinding but introduces signal-specific logic when required.
- Example: 
  - **TrafficNode** instances are managed by **TrafficManager** for signal control.
  - Standard nodes act as simple graph points in algorithms, minimizing overhead.

---

### 4. **Real-world Analogy**:
- **Node**: Generic road intersection.
- **TrafficNode**: Intersection with a traffic light influencing vehicle behavior.

---

## ü§ù Work Distribution

All members of the team have contributed equally to all aspects of the project, adopting a collaborative approach rather than dividing tasks individually. Given the scale and complexity of the project, it became clear that assigning isolated responsibilities would not be effective. The interconnected nature of components like pathfinding, traffic management, EV simulation, and frontend visualization required every member to have a holistic understanding of the entire system. 

To ensure this, the team worked together on:

1. **Pathfinding and JNI Integration**:
   - Jointly implementing and optimizing the native pathfinding logic.
   - Collaboratively managing JNI data conversion between Java and C++.

2. **Game Map and Parsing**:
   - Parsing road network data, building the **GameMap**, and ensuring accurate connectivity through team discussions and development sessions.

3. **Traffic Management**:
   - Designing traffic light cycles and movement constraints collectively, ensuring everyone understood the intricate dependencies.

4. **EV Simulation and Controller**:
   - Working as a team to define EV behaviors, movement logic, and REST API integration, avoiding siloed knowledge.

5. **Task Assignment and Buffering**:
   - Co-developing the task queue and task prioritization logic, ensuring fair distribution of knowledge and effort.

6. **Frontend/Visualization**:
   - Collaboratively creating the interface for real-time updates and visualization, reinforcing a shared understanding of the output.

This approach ensured that all team members were equipped to debug, extend, and maintain any part of the project, highlighting the importance of shared responsibility for a project of this scale.
