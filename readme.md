### Native Library Configuration
The project uses a JNI (Java Native Interface) approach with a C++ Dijkstra implementation:

#### Windows Configuration
1. Locate `dijkstra_jni.dll` in `Vehicle-Simulation/lib`
2. Add the DLL directory to system PATH
   - Open System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables
   - Append DLL directory path to PATH variable

#### Linux/Mac Configuration
1. Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:
   ```bash
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/native/lib
   ```

## 🛠 Installation and Deployment
